This is a set of UDF functions for MySQL originally written by Jan Steeman.

http://mysql-udf.sourceforge.net/

These functions have been brought up to date with the MySQL API, and I added some functions (such as STEYX from Excel).
I added a build system (simple Makefile) to easily compile all functions as a single library which can be installed with
other MySQL plugins. The development environment for this library is Ubuntu Linux (64bit). The library should build cleanly on any
standard Linux development machine with g++ and the MySQL development libraries and headers installed.

The import.sql script provides the necesary commands to import the UDF functions into MySQL. You need to be an administrator
to be able to do that.
